## GSL 2024 Lunar New Year Party
PLEASE JOIN US FOR THE ***GSL Lunar New Year Party*** on ***9 February 2024 11:30-1:00*** at GC402.   
2024 is the year of 龙 (pronounced as Long), starting from February 10th, 2024 (NOTE: GSL’s party is right on New Year’s Eve). The Dragon symbolizes power, nobleness, honor, luck, and success in traditional Chinese culture. The Dragon is a supernatural being with no parallel for talent and excellence.
